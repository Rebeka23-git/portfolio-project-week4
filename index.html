              The primary aim of plyometric exercises is to strengthen muscles,
              which allow athletes to run, jump faster and increase their
              overall mobility. These exercises benefit anyone involved in
              sports that involves a significant amount of running, kicking, and
              jumping. Plyometric exercise helps significantly with movement
              because they rapidly stretch the muscles.
